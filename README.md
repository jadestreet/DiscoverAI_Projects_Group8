"In this proposed system we take the video metadata as input and apply the NLP techniques for text classification which categories the video and assigns a relevant advertisement to it. 
The second module takes the video as an input. Thereafter the video is converted into N individual frames to tackle the video classification as an image classification problem. In this proposed system we train a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the topic of the video on an image dataset and compare its performance with a pre-trained model. We create the image dataset by downloading images from the internet. "
